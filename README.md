# arctiblaine-daily-neopets
I made this simple website with quick links to help me finish my Neopets dailies faster. I uploaded my php file to GitHub in order to use it when I am not using my machine. It is also for others to make their own simple webpage if they wish (Neopets has an HTML tutorial!)

Website is live here! https://arctiblaine.github.io/arctiblaine-daily-neopets/main
